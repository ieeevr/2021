<h2 id="overview"> Overview </h2>
<p>
    IEEE VR 2021 seeks original, high-quality papers in all areas related to virtual reality (VR), including augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and 3D user interfaces (3DUIs).
</p>

<p>
    For inquiries, contact: conferencepapers2021 [at] ieeevr.org
</p>



<h2 id="submission-guidelines"> Submission Guidelines </h2>

<p>
    Each research paper should be a validated contribution covering one or more of four styles of papers methodological, technology, applications, or systems. Papers are welcome that provide contributions in more than one of these areas. Authors should select a primary designation for submissions:

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Methodological papers</strong> should describe advances in theories and methods of AR/VR/MR and 3DUI, such as ethical issues, theories on presence, or human factors.</li>
        <li><strong>Technology papers</strong> should describe advancements in algorithms or devices critical to AR/VR/MR and 3DUI development such as input, display, user interaction, or tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Application papers</strong> provide an important insight to the community by explaining how the authors built upon existing ideas and applied them to solve an interesting problem in a novel way. </li>Each paper should include an evaluation of the success of the use of AR/VR/MR and 3DUI in the given application domain.
        <li><strong>System papers</strong> should indicate how the developers integrated techniques and technologies to produce an effective system, and convey any lessons learned in the process.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Each paper should include an evaluation of its contributions appropriate to its type (e.g., user study, case study, expert user feedback, system comparisons, technical benchmarking).
</p>

<p>
    We welcome paper submissions between 4 and 8 pages, <strong>NOT including</strong> references. Note that there are no distinct categories for short papers or technotes. The contribution of the paper will be weighed against its length during review. All submissions will receive at least three reviews by experts in the field to ensure quality of accepted submissions. All accepted submissions must be presented orally at the conference. Conference Papers will appear in the Proceedings of IEEE VR and be archived in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Starting from 2018 the Conference Paper track is distinct from the Journal Paper track.
</p>

<p>
    Authors are asked to identify one or more broad topic areas for each submission. It is understood that these topic areas overlap, and authors should identify primary and, if necessary, secondary broad topic areas (#1, #2 or #3 below) by priority within the submission system. Authors should note that the conference paper chairs will use this information only to assist with assigning the most appropriate reviewers while also balancing reviewer workload. Reviewers will also indicate similar broad topic area priorities based on their expertise. There is no quota for the number of accepted submissions per topic area, and the overall program will be based on the highest quality contributions to the field as judged across all topics.
</p>

<h2 id="aditional-submission-guidelines"> Additional Submission Guidelines </h2>
<p>
    All paper submissions must be in English.
    All IEEE VR Conference Paper submissions must be prepared in IEEE Computer Society VGTC format (<a href="http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html">http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html</a>) and submitted in PDF format.
    We highly encourage authors to use the LaTeX template. 
    However, authors who choose to use the MS Word template should ensure that the PDF submission matches the PDF format template (<a href="http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Templates/october2017/vgtc_conference_latex.pdf">http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Templates/october2017/vgtc_conference_latex.pdf</a>).
</p>

<p>
    <div class="notice--info">
        <b>Failure to make reasonable attempts to adhere to the formatting guidelines will result in desk rejection.</b>
    </div>
</p>

<p>
    Paper submissions must not have been previously published. A manuscript is considered to have been previously published if it has appeared in peer-reviewed journals, magazines, books, or meeting proceedings that are permanently available afterward in print or electronic form to non-attendees, regardless of the publication language. A prior 2-page abstract is not considered a previous publication and therefore would not prohibit acceptance.
